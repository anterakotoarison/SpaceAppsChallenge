This application was created for the CSA challenge 1, stargaze level. 


It utilizes the tkinter library to create an interactive GUI for python.


The Welcome window contains the start button to begin the application. Then the user can enter their location and date of interest. The next window contains the main explore page. The user can choose what data they want to explore at the given location and date. 


Four options are available: 

- Number of satellites at different altitude ranges
- Space weather
- De-orbiting satellites
- Near earth asteroids

The user can also choose get a summary report of all the available data. 

The Neosat and Cassiope dataset were meant to be used in the application. However due to technical issues and time constraints, we were unable to implement the data into the program. However, the dataset from Skyfield was utilized to create orbit plots. 

Although the program is unfinished with most features not implemented yet, we created a basic mock-up of how we wanted it to look like. 

The application and information presented in it are intended for middle school students that are curious about understanding what is happening in space.
